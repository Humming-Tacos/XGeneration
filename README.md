# XGeneration
### The AI Composition package for Humming Tacos

Only for model inference. The training and preprocessing scripts are removed. Download the pretrained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKqBCrkfhDTt0B1nw7mDndJ7RpMNKAk5/view?usp=sharing).

The XGeneration pipeline is as follows:

#### Task1: Melody Continuation

Given a 4-bar phrase, generate AABA-structured melody.

#### Task2: Chord Generation

Generate simple chord for the melody from task1, output lead sheet (melody + chord).

#### Task3: Accompaniment Generation

Generate Chinese pop style piano accompaniment based on the lead sheet.
